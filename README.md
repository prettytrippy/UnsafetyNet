# UnsafetyNet

We've all experienced the following:
- You are 8, and your mom prohibits anymore eating dirt, for the sake of your health
- You are 15, and a police officer rudely informs you that driving twice the speed limit without a license is punishable by law
- You are 20, and your apartment building **refuses to let you set off fireworks in their parking lot, despite the fact that you texted Christie and told here you'd do it by the train tracks, far away from the fence and building, and that your roommate would bring the fire extinguisher from the kitchen for extra safety, and you really, really think it would be a fun, community-building exercise, and make everyone feel more like neighbors, and it would look sick, and probably get them a lot of tenants for next year, but they hate fun and cool-looking explosions**  

It's clear from the above --- the main problem plaguing society today is our obsession with safety.
Safety makes everything less fun. *True freedom* means the ability to fail. The same is true in computer science. Error messages fill the screen with unreadable nonsense. Minor issues cause processes to terminate right before major breakthroughs could have occured. Most of the time, errors aren't even my fault, but, rather, the result of fluke solar flares. Something needs to change.  
  
We must remind ourselves what computer science is all about: ChatGPT wrapper startups, having 13 different 10 GB Conda environments on your local machine, and user privacy agreement violations. Safety was never meant to be one of our virtues.  

With this in mind, I present UnsafetyNet, the world's first deep learning library with no error checking. No matter what you do (assuming the code compiles), you will never see a single error message when running this code (except for multiple SEGFAULTs). This is deep learning, done right.
