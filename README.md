# UnsafetyNet

Consider the following:
- You are 8, and your mom prohibits anymore eating dirt, for the sake of your health
- You are 15, and a police officer rudely informs you that driving twice the speed limit without a license is punishable by law
- You are 20, and your apartment building **refuses to let you set off fireworks in their parking lot**  

The main problem plaguing society today is our obsession with safety.
Safety makes everything less fun. Try freedom means the ability to fail.
With this in mind, I present UnsafetyNet, the world's first deep learning library with no error checking.
